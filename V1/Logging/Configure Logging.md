# Message logging configuration
Edge System writes daily log messages to flat text files in the following locations:
• Windows: %ProgramData%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Logs
• Linux: /usr/share/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Logs
Each message in the log displays the message severity level, timestamp, and the message itself
